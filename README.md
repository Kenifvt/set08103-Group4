## Steps in contributing !!
1. **Always keep your brances up to date!!** (might make a script for it later)
2. Then, it’s best practice to create a separate branch inside of feature for each new pull request (PR) you create. This can be done using:
   ~~~ 
    git checkout -b feature/name_of_your_branch
   ~~~ 
3.Start working on the assigned tasks, and open a PR as soon as you have a full or partial solution, when you open the PR make sure to follow the [conventional commits format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), and then directly reference the issue in the pull request by adding the following content to the description of the PR:
~~~ 
    Close #Issue_number
~~~
4. Wait for your PR to be reviewed by at least one other team member. Based on the feedback, you may either merge your PR (if approved) or make the necessary adjustments. Only merge your PR into the **develop** branch once approval has been given.
5. During the PR review process, the other team member should focus on the code quality, functionality, and whether the PR effectively addresses the issue it is linked to. Reviewers should provide constructive feedback to promote continuous improvement. This is important so when it is time for the main Code Reviews we can perform well !
6. Upon receiving approval, merge your changes into the **develop** branch. Ensure to pull the latest changes from develop and resolve any conflicts before the final merge to maintain a stable code base.
7. Features merged into develop will be periodically reviewed and tested as a part of the preparation for merging into the main and then release branches ! ✈️
